Some major next steps that we have identified at the end of term 1:
* setting up search feature
* add way to search for resources (check advanced search in figms prototype)
* connect "resource suggestions" page to database or send it to admin for the approval
* configure Mailer so that email confimation and password confirmation works
* populate database that Nicole provided us with information about resources (category, description, etc)
* check usability depending on screen size (mobile phone, tablet, laptop, ect) - nav bar/search/footer all need work
